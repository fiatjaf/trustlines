### On a payment that involves A->B->C what happens if C withholds the hash from B, but later tries to claim its debt, showing the hashed contract and the preimage?

B is free to pay or to not pay, as always. These hashed contracts are not legally binding or anything. Remember this is a network of debts between trusted friends.

### On a payment that involves A->B->C->D what ensures D will not cheat and pass the preimage to B while not passing it to C?

Nothing, but if C doesn't get to know the preimage then he is free to ignore his payment to D in the actual world. Remember we're not transferring money here, just promises based on trust between friends.
